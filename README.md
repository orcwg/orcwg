# ORC WG

The Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group is a neutral forum where community and industry can work out supply chain compliance together.

The Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC) Working Group is built on four core pillars:
- üéì **Education & Thought Leadership** - Close the knowledge gap. We create clarity around regulation and its implications for open source. By offering guidance, workshops, and public sessions like CRA Mondays, we help developers, maintainers, and stakeholders stay informed and involved.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Development** - From best practices to specifications. We translate community experience into reusable tools, guidance, and specifications. These serve as the foundation for compliance strategies and feed into formal standardization efforts aligned with CRA requirements.
- ü§ù **Institutional Engagement** - Bridge community and policy. We actively coordinate with institutions, ensuring open source perspectives are heard in regulatory dialogues and that collaboration replaces confusion.
- üì£ **Representation** - A stronger voice together. The CRA opens a new chapter for open source accountability. The more contributors and communities we bring to the table, the more credible, inclusive, and effective our response will be.

## Special Interest Groups
The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) brings new regulatory expectations for the software industry, affecting also the open source. Open source communities need a place to come together and respond ‚Äî collectively, practically, and globally.
The Cyber [Cyber Resilience SIG](./cyber-resilience-sig/) is where ORC WG is addressing the CRA challenges

## Members of the working group
To truly represent the open source ecosystem and shape meaningful, practical responses to the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), diversity of participation is essential. ORC WG comprises from individual maintainers to large-scale open source foundations, and from startups to global enterprises. A wide range of voices ensures that CRA responses reflect the real-world complexity of how open source is built, maintained, and secured.

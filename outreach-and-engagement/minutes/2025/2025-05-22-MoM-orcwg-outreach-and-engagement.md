  - **Nordic Software Security Summit**: EF's Security team might attend; confirmation needed.
  - **RIPE**: A conversation is needed with Alistair to evaluate relevance and interest.
  - **Code & Compliance Community Day**: This is the ORC community event for the fall, aligned with the CRA Expert Group meeting. This might be an opportunity to review vertical standards.
  - **SFS Con**: Will feature a CRA-focused track; participation seen as relevant and timely.
  - **GitHub Universe**: Seen as a good fit to engage younger developers.
  - **Black Hat Europe**: Identified as a must-attend; high relevance to ORC mission.

  - **Action**: Open deck for public/community feedback.
- Discussion on promotional materials:
  - General consensus that swag would be valuable for speakers (e.g., shirts, stickers).

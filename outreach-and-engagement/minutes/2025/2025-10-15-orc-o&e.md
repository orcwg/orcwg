## Minutes

- Outreach & Engagement will move to the end of the SIG meeting (rather than a standalone call) to improve attendance.  
- Video interview ideas:
  - Strategic members  
  - Taskforce leads  
  - Non-members in attendance  
- Next Code & Compliance event will be held with FOSDEM â€” the *Save the Date* will be announced at Code & Compliance next week.  
- ORC communications need increased diversity of faces and voices.  
  - Co-chairs will be the first volunteers and hopefully encourage other community members to participate.
  - Challenge: Not everyone wants to be the face, even if they are a subject matter expert.

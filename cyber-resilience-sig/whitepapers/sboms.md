# White paper on SBOMs

## Abstract

Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) play a crucial role in the implementation of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), in particular for vulnerability handling. Yet, there are no agreed-upon best practices for the usage and adoption of SBOMs across open source communities and numerous misunderstandings about how they work. There are competing standards, disagreements about whether open source projects should provide SBOMs or whether they're artifacts that integrators of open source components should generate, disagreements about the data they should contain, and a general lack of neutral information on the topic.

The goal of this white paper is to fill this gap by providing commonly agreed upon information about SBOMs and their role in the open source ecosystem and provide recommendations for their adoption in the context of the CRA.

This white paper will leverage the resources collected in the [inventory][] and will be contributed to the [EU Commission][], the [CRA Expert Group][], and [CEN/CENELEC][].

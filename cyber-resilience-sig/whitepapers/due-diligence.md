# White paper on due diligence obligation of manufacturers

The due diligence obligation of manufacturers outlined in [Article 13(5)][] of the CRA is the cornerstone of the relationship between manufacturers and the open source ecosystem.

This white paper will attempt to clarify this obligation along with the related requirement that integrated open source components must not compromise the cybersecurity of the products they are integrated into. It will list the constraints manufacturers might face when integrating open source components‚Äîin particular components which aren't supported by open source software stewards, and propose solutions to enable manufacturers to continue leveraging open source components securely and at scale despite those constraints.

Secondly, this paper will outline steps that open source projects could take to help facilitate this due diligence obligation‚Äînotably by providing increased transparency about their security posture, recommend existing standards or specification that projects could adopt, and propose new ones where appropriate.

Finally, this paper will examine the tension between the practical necessity for manufacturers to shift security left (i.e. with the open source projects) and their inability to compel those projects to take on this responsability‚Äîgiven that compliance obligations rightfully rest with the manufacturers‚Äîand will underline the need for incentives-aligning mechanisms to resolve this tension.

This white paper will be shared with the [EU Commission][] and the [CRA Expert Group][] and will provide important context for the [Specification on generic security requirements for open source components][].

Note: This white paper might be combined with the paper on [security attestations][].

# Open Source Software Stewards and CRA Whitepaper

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) defines a new category of organizations, open-source software stewards (stewards hereafter). It also defines obligations for them that are different from those of other categories like manufacturers.

This whitepaper will aim at elaborating on the obligations, restrictions, and penalties that will be imposed to stewards.

From the elaboration on the legal text, we will outline the missing pieces / documents / procedures that stewards need to have to fulfil their obligations.

The goal is NOT to provide a definition or guidance about who is and who is not a steward for an Product with Digital Element qualifying as Open Source Software.

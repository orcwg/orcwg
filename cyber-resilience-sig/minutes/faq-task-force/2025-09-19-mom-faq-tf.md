* [find new meeting time](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/issues/174)  
* Hard to find a time because of CEN/CENELEC comment review activity  
* Tobie to propose a few options

### Status update

* [Roadmap](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/issues/262)  
* We need to discuss v1.1 (what happens after FOSDEM)
* Treat as open source project that is continuously updated and improved
* We‚Äôll have to plan for how we handle the V1 release:
  * Process  
  * V1 vs bleeding edge in parallel?  
  * Etc.  
* Keep this discussion going as the project evolves in the upcoming months   
* We'll also want to think about a longer timeline
* Plan for 2026? Rolling release process? Cadence?

### Discuss proposed goals & review process

### Discussion about open source workstrand of the CRA Expert Group (Tobie)

* Update on the work of the CRA Expert Group and its relationship to the FAQ was provided.  
* CRA Expert Group open source workstrand is focused on providing input to the Commission on the open source Guidance the commission will publish  
* This guidance will have similar legal standing as the recitals in the CRA  
* FAQ serves as input to this work  
* The guidance is for market authorities, judges, etc., it will be hard to parse for our constituencies  
* Makes the FAQ work even more valuable as a result  
* The guidance is going to clarify a lot of the issues we raised  
* The FAQ should leverage this to provide answers in layperson terms, possibly sourcing them by pointing to guidance.

### AOB

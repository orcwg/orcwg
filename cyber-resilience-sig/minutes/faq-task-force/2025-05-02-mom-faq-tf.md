## Notes

* Approve minutes for [April 4](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/pull/79) and [April 18](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/pull/80) meetings  
  * Agreement to approve minutes but we need to discuss how the work is split as theres confusion  
* Discuss how the work is split  
  * Same group of people can work on multiple categories  
  * We won’t modify categories just now, but will revisit them as we move forward and start addressing questions  
* How do we manage the tension between providing input to the Commission and creating an FAQ  
  * Tobie to create index of all of the issues that need to be addressed by the commission  
* Do we breakdown the questions that we receive or do we leave them as is?  
  * We beaking questions down into chunks is the way to go  
  * FAQ table  
* How can we merge faster and earlier?  
  * Tobie to change the process to remove SIG review as step and make this lighter (peer review for complex cases, and personnel judgement otherwise)  
  * Focus first on moving all of the issues in triage to identify the question and add at least the question to faq.md  
* AOB

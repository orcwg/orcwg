## Collaboration on BSI (Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) and FSFE questionnaire

* Michael Schuster & Alexander Sander  
* Focus is more on civil society, but includes additional stakeholders  
* [Proposal](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/tree/tobie-questionnaires/questionnaires#questionnaire-for-open-source-and-manufacturers)  
* [Related pull request](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/pull/168)  
  * They need feedback on the survey by the week of March 28th, plan to meet to finalize it the following week.  
  * The expected outcome from the survey is not only answers but also new questions to provide guidance.  
  * Common effort aligning this survey with the FAQ, and consulting them to the CRA Expert Group and the EC as a potential way forward.

## Technical definitions of Important & Critical Products

* [Proposal](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/blob/tobie-prod-reg/product-definitions/README.md#current-consultations)  
* [Related pull request](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/pull/164)  
* It was presented the methodology to work on the proposal, submitting comments via pull request.  
* As a note: The definitions could be amended by other European laws, not only the CRA.

## Collaboration with the EU Commission

* Presented to the EC the Deliverable Plan with positive feedback.  
* It was suggested to have a joint brainstorming as each deliverable is started, and when the first draft is ready.  
* It is necessary to create an explainer for each deliverable to present them to ETSI and CEN/CENELEC \- simplifying people to understand the work we are doing.  
* **EXPLAINER** concept \- high level description of 1 page describing what the next piece of work will look like.

## Task force on advocacy / thought leadership?

* [Related issue](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/issues/52#issuecomment-2723901813)

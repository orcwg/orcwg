## Notes

### Approval of the minutes
- Approved and merged after the meeting

### Status of the whitepaper
- There has been activity during the last days in the PR
- However, some comments have not been considered. We will reach out to the leaders of the white paper to make sure all comments are reviewed.

### CEN/CENELEC PT3 Status
- The European Commission has requested to include open source as part of PT3 standard. We will be discussing how to contribute and what part of the work already developed can be push to the standard.
- The Steering Committee will discuss the approach and keep the WG informed about actions and expectations.

### Glossary - PT4
- The first proposal is an approach to be discussed based on the first inputs
- It was proposed to add OSI to the definitions
- Since the scope of the work goes beyond the contribution to PT4, it was proposed to check CPANSec glossary work to learn from their experience

### AOB
None

## Notes
### Whitepaper status
- The initial discussion relied on who is responsible for maintaining and implementing the security policy that the CRA impose on the stewards:
 - Steward has this policy available and applies it to its projects.
 - Transfer to the project level the responsibility of having the policy, but this option was considered as not fitting the steward definition.
 - Reference terms of ASF: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SECURITY/Project+Security+Response+Formal+Escalation 

- Two ways of failing were identified:
  - Entity declared as steward but failing to comply with it.
  - A steward which meets the requirements for acting as that, but fails due to lack of resources.
- The projects that are not well funded and cannot comply with the obligations of a steward should be declared unstewarded. Examples will be included in the White paper.
- **Action Point - Include FAQ entries to clarify this.** 
- The white paper will focus on stewards, and only on those key aspects of the steward role, corner cases.

### Status of PT3
- CEN/CENELEC PT3 discussions are stuck due to the large number of comments.
- We will bring to the SIG meeting the discussion around the approach and key discussion points.
- The standard should be ready by mid Oct.
 - Comments addressed by 1st of Oct.
 - Editorial work finished by 14th of October

### Action points
- [ ] Include FAQ entries to clarify doubts around failing steward obligation

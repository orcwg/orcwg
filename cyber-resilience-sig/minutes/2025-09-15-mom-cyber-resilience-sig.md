### Update from Steering Committees

- During the last SC there were two topics that concentrate the focus of the meeting:  
  - Staff update \- already shared in the previous point.  
  - CEN/CENELEC PT3 \- Current version of CEN/CENENELEC PT on vulnerability handling is not well aligned with the reality of open source, and the European Commission has requested to include open source. For the SC this is an opportunity to reinvigorate the initial efforts put into creating a document that includes open source stewards under the CRA. The deadline is quite challenging since the document should be ready before PT3 closes the current working draft, which is expected to happen in October. 

### Vulnerability Handling TF update \- PT3 \+ White paper

- Marta presented the next steps in the preparation of the white paper. It is still needed for volunteers to go through the FAQ to provide inputs based on what is already included. As part of the next step, it is expected:  
  - Go through existing comments in the PR.  
  - Development of more text.  
- Dan A. from OpenSSF shared the work they are developing with the [one-pager on stewards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVx7V1sHoIYsztLYSMEb_HAAgw9FjBraJDwW7tz3i-k/edit?tab=t.0), suggesting a good alignment to be sure we are sending the same message. The core audience for the one-pager is LF projects.  
- Regarding PT3, it was asked about the next steps if the contributions from open source are not included. As discussed in a common Steering and Specification Committees meeting, the plan is to launch a campaign to communicate the risks and problems associated with the current approach.

### Glossary work

- The current work is directed towards CEN/CENELEC PT4, but it is still needed to decide as a community what comes next. 

### Status of the FAQ and inventory

- The new structure has been merged into the main branch, and there is an ongoing effort to adapt existing comments and discussions to the new format.  
- It was pointed out that it is necessary to define entry level question to complement what is already included in the current discussions.  
- The FAQ meeting is scheduled for this Friday 13.30 CEST, however, there is a discussion open to change the slot since the current one collides with a regular ETSI meeting. Those interested in participating in the FAQ meetings, please share your availability.

### Code & Compliance \+ Marketing Update

- Code & Compliance:  
  - It is time to register \- Do not forget that our WG members have a discount code.  
  - The program is being finalised, and the first speakers will be announced in the coming days.  
- Marketing update:  
  - There is a marketing community call tomorrow \- the main focus is the creation of community content, and the opportunities around it, considering the upcoming event, but also other opportunities.  
  - It was also requested that members of the community presenting the WG or activities related to the WG to inform Shanda or Juan or both, so the WG helps to amplify their presence.

### AOB

- None

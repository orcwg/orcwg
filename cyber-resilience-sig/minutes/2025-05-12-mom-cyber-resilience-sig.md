  * Looking for folks who are familiar with the network stack to get involved  

#### CEN/CENELEC PT3 
* Vulnerability management spec  
* Spec is making progress  
* Mostly based on ISO 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111 (on vuln handling)
* Might provide presumption of conformity  
* PT now has a rapporteur, as a result org is changing  
* 2x 2h meetings per week  
* No surprises so far  
* Lars, Timo, Arnouf (from ASF) are writing the section on open source stewards: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERHsVmER9Bc4pgDJjMZJyWWekJn7PEMfFSJqDTItVEI/edit?tab=t.0   
* What is the section on open source stewards for?  
  * Open section  
  * Standards are not strictly meant for stewards themselves (so mostly informative)  
  * Received guidance from the WG9 chair on this section:  
    * This is an informative chapter (that’s good!)  
    * Provide guidance and concepts for chapter 5
    * Provide clarity as to whom is in scope for the standard (between manufacturer and stewards)  
    * Don’t repro content from the CRA  
    * The shorter the explanation, the better off we are (keep it high level and simplistic)  
    * Due next Wednesday
    * Should move to GitHub before then	  
  * Tobie to organize PT3 discussion call

### Open Digital Ecosystems CfE

Proposal:

1. **Practical Portability and Interoperability:** Encourage open, documented APIs and formats to allow full project data portability across software forges (like issues, metadata, security info). This reduces platform lock-in and improves business continuity and supply-chain resilience.  
2. **Resilient Digital Services:** Recognise build, distribution, and dependency services (e.g., package repositories) as critical infrastructure. Support their resilience through contingency planning, EU-based mirrors, and encouraging an 'Upstream First' development model to enhance security and value capture.  
3. **Compliance Enablement through Open Source Tools:** Actively support open source compliance tooling (e.g., for SBOM generation, vulnerability tracking, license analysis). This lowers implementation costs and complexity, helping companies (especially SMEs) demonstrate compliance efficiently.  
4. **Reliable Identification of Software Components:** Endorse content-based, persistent identifiers like **SWHIDs** as best practice for software artifacts. This strengthens supply-chain security, supports CRA implementation, and improves long-term auditability.  
5. **Responsible Use of Open Source in AI Development:** Promote traceability mechanisms to link AI-generated code back to its archived origins. This enhances legal certainty, security, and trust in AI-assisted development.

The core message is that open digital ecosystems are a strategic enabler of Europe’s technological sovereignty and competitiveness, and the most effective path is to focus on enablement rather than enforcement to make regulation a "shared framework for trust and resilience."

- Comments:   
  - Maybe replace SWHID with PURL (that exists in CVE program and OSV) instead of proposing new unused identifiers (OEJ)  
  - Need for federated services instead of centralised. Open protocols. (OEJ)  
  - Adding EU-STF to the list of suggestions (Mathias)  


### Code and Compliance summary

- Juan: Great meeting, good feedback, a lot of interaction  
- Session slides will be uploaded this week  
- Video will come after  
- Dirk: Maybe present some of the videos as training material \- some presentations should be highlighted separately and not part of conference documentation  
- Shanda: Some of the videos will be edited and used in short form in other ways  
- Over 120 participants\! Our first sold-out event  
- The ORC mascot name was revealed: REGGIE\!  
- A big thank you from the group to the organising team\!

### Voluntary Attestations
- During Code and Compliance, the  [Voluntary Security Attestations survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/CRA-Attestation-Survey-2026-FOSDEM) was launched
- We already have 20 answers. Please help to spread the word.

### Due diligence

- [Reference document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IpLqgWogDNGzN4J51L1pXQv0GsCYR4xPdn-BwXVBrk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z7oxwfl0u8fm%20) with the outcomes of the workshop and previous work   
- Timo: Short presentation in C\&C  
- Recognised as a worthy topic by the participants  
- Timo: Rudimentary content in the doc, needs more eyes and energy\!  
- Meetings on Thursdays in the Vulnerability handling slot.  
- Timo and OEj will produce some ideas for Shanda to communicate in all media. This needs to go out early to get more energy but also communicate that we are working on this.

### Open Source Stewards White Paper

- Launched with a clear section to scope it properly.  
- Communication activities planned.  
- See [LInkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-regulatory-compliance_orcwg-cra-cyberresilienceact-activity-7424023508449587201-bvGA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAUJbw0BpUu3czyWQOSPQylhK4kVVMJ4wXo) and repost and like to spread the word\!  
- Document will be updated \- we need to define scope and contributors.  
- Add issues in the issue tracker

### Status of the FAQ and inventory

- Inventory will be launched in the coming weeks.  
  - 95% completed  
  - Available on GitHub  
- FAQ  
  - Presented by Tobie during Code and Compliance  
  - The presentation covered both the process and the content.

### Marketing Update

- Shanda introduced the high level view of the marketing plan.  
- Slides can be found here – ADD THE LINK   
- Funnel: Awareness (L1), Understand (L2), Contribute (L3)  
- New webinar series: Unpacking the CRA  
- See separate [slides](./2026-02-02-orc-mkt-plan-overview.pdf)  
- Feedback:  
  - OEJ: Maybe using the Open Source org members more  
  - Jeremy Stanley proposed putting folks in touch with OpenInfra Foundation marketing and events

### Training material update

- Book 15-minute meeting with Shanda to discuss your needs for CRA training:

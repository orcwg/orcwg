# Deliverables Plan

In 2025, the [Cyber Resilience SIG][SIG] will focus on deliverables necessary to help the open source community (and notably _open source software stewards_) meet the regulatory obligations outlined in the CRA and help downstream users (_manufacturers_) be able to continue to leverage open source in their products and services while meeting their own regulatory requirements. This is expressed by the colored nodes and edges in the diagram below.

## Key stakeholders

The [Cyber Resilience SIG][SIG] intends to collaborate closely with and provide input to the following stakeholders:

* EU Commission
* CRA Expert Group
* CEN/CENELEC
* ETSI
* ENISA
* Market Surveillance Authorities

## Equivalence between products and open source components

The CRA focuses mainly on the compliance of products, but that doesn't mean that there aren't equivalent concepts targeted at open source components. The following table compares products and open source components and references relevant [Cyber Resilience SIG][SIG] deliverables for each.

| Role | For products | Equivalent for open source components | Relevant deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compliance requirements** | Ensure product is designed, developed and produced in accordance with the essential cybersecurity requirements | Exercise due diligence | [White paper on due diligence][due diligence] | 
| **Helps meet compliance requirements** | CEN/CENELEC and ETSI harmonised standards | TBD | [Principles for cyber resilience][cyber resilience principles] and [Generic security requirements][] specs |
| **Indicates compliance** | CE Mark | Security Attestation | [White paper on attestations][security attestations] | 
| **Provides information to users** | Technical documentation | TBD | [Principles for cyber resilience][cyber resilience principles] and [Generic security requirements][] specs |
| **Manage vulnerabilities** | CEN/CENELEC and ETSI harmonised standards | ORC WG specification | [Vulnerability management spec][vulnerability management] |

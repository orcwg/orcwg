### Minutes from the previous meeting
Approved, will be merged after the call

### White paper Status
- Additions done
- Stewards from outside Europe, onne of the key topics to clarify:
  - there are FAQs about this already created
  - We have requested the European Commission on the topic
  - Link to FAQ entry on identifying your project’s/steward’s market surveillance authority

- ENISA reporting platform. It is not clear how open source actors should use it
 - It is on the agenda for the next CRA Expert Group, we will try to get clarity on the topic.

### Next Steps in the TF
- Normalization of processes
- Essential elements of vulnerability-reporting.md for stewards, not only big foundations, but flexible to fit all projects - work on a template.
  - OpenSSF already provides a [template for their own projects](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/SECURITY.md) as of the past couple of years, and has codified the recommendation in their [Security Baseline as OSPS-VM-01.01](https://baseline.openssf.org/versions/2025-02-25#osps-vm-0101)

### AOB

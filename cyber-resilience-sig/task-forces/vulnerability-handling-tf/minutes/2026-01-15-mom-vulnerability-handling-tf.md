## Notes

* The deliverable is getting ready\!  
  * “Open Source Software Stewards and CRA whitepaper v1.0”  
  * The first whitepaper from the ORCWG, 20 pages  
  * Only editorial changes from the markdown doc  
    [https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/cyber-resilience-sig/whitepapers/stewards-and-cra.md](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/cyber-resilience-sig/whitepapers/stewards-and-cra.md)  
  * A big thank you to everyone who contributed  
* Next steps  
  * From the repo:  
    * SBOMs  
    * Due diligence \- started, spearheaded by Nokia  
    * Project types  
  * Where do we have the energy to write, edit and work in the group?  
* Due diligence:  
  * Different viewpoints  
    * As a manufacturer  
      * Legal  
      * Compliance  
      * (not primarily developers)  
    * As an Open Source project  
    * As an Open Source steward  
    * Maybe split in multiple docs based on target group  
  * Needs automation to scale, to not put a burden on either party  
  * How the manufacturer can help the community  
  * Current state (a template/skeleton)  
    * [https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/cyber-resilience-sig/whitepapers/due-diligence.md](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/cyber-resilience-sig/whitepapers/due-diligence.md)  
  * Example of traditional compliance organizations starting to address this:  
    * [https://eucyberact.org/session/linux-kernel-security-assessment-for-cra-compliance-f11a/](https://eucyberact.org/session/linux-kernel-security-assessment-for-cra-compliance-f11a/)  
  * Further work:  
    * Will be discussed in general meeting  
    * Will be discussed in Code & Compliance  
    * Timo takes the lead  
* Salve: Input to steward doc:  
  * The project and steward may not have a strong connection  
  * Maintainers are usually volunteers  
  * Salve thinks we need to fix this before publishing  
  * \=\> Needs to go into the FAQ probably  
  * \=\> Open issue in tracker for v 1.1 of the steward doc  
* Aeva: Attestation wg  
  * As the work wraps up, do we want to publish separated by wg or as an ORCWG publication?  
* Juan: A handbook for stewards  
* Salve:   
  * Has long term management of these white papers been discussed?  
* OEJ: Is there a meeting place for Stewards  
  * Open source congress  
    * Organised by OSI  
    * Once a year event  
    * Private Mailing list  
    * [https://www.opensourcecongress.org/event/fb27ccee-0093-45b2-b465-179e4d5dea1e](https://www.opensourcecongress.org/event/fb27ccee-0093-45b2-b465-179e4d5dea1e)  
    * Hosted by different organisations  
  * Maybe a need for an ongoing forum, a knowledge exchange between stewards and projects that wish to become/have stewards. Probably good to establish this over next \~year, before COMM requests feedback from OSS community as input to refine regulations (in \~5-7 years).

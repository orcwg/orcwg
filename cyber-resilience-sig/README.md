# Cyber Resilience SIG

Cyber Resilience Special Interest Group (SIG) of ORC WG.

## Meetings

* [Meeting info](../MEETINGS.md)
* [Minutes](./minutes/)

## Leads
* Dirk-Willem van Gulik ([@dirkx][]), The Apache Software Foundation
* Simon Phipps ([@webmink][]), Software Heritage Foundation - Inria Foundation
* Timo Perala ([@timop62][]), Nokia

## Scope

The Scope of the Cyber Resilience SIG is a strict subset of the scope of ORC WG. Whereas the working group is chartered to address any kind of emerging regulation impacting open source, the Cyber Resilience SIG is solely focused on cyber resilience regulation. Expect all of the CRA-related work to happen in this SIG.

## Deliverables Plan

In 2025, the SIG will focus on deliverables necessary to help the open source community (and notably _open source software stewards_) meet the regulatory obligations outlined in the CRA and help downstream users (_manufacturers_) be able to continue to leverage open source in their products and services while meeting their own regulatory requirements.

## Cyber Resilience Practices Project

In its [Deliverables Plan](./deliverables.md), the SIG has identified a [set of specifications](./deliverables.md#4-specifications) that are required to further its mission. The intention is for the Cyber Resilience Practices Project to host these specifications and develop them with guidance from the SIG.

* Mikael Barbero ([@mbarbero][]), Eclipse Foundation

## Task Forces

The Cyber Resilience SIG can form task forces that focus on a particular topic for a fixed period of time.

A task force must have one or more leads, an area of focus, a set of deliverables, and an end date by which it must present its deliverables and recommendations to the SIG and/or request an extension.

A task force's proceedings are public.

Task forces do not have any decision-making authority. Their role is advisory. Their deliverables do not represent the consensus of the SIG nor of the WG unless the SIG or WG formally adopts them.

### Current task forces

| Name | Focus Area | Lead(s) | Deliverables | Minutes | End date |

## Key stakeholder coordination

In its [Deliverables Plan](./deliverables.md), the SIG has identified [key stakeholders](./deliverables.md#key-stakeholders) that it intends to collaborate closely with and provide input to. In order to coordinate this effort, the SIG relies on a [shared calendar][coord calendar] ([iCal format][coord ical]) and representatives from within its members. For their group or subgroups, liaisons leads (identified in the table below) are responsible for:

1. Keeping the [shared calendar][coord calendar] up to date.
2. Making sure important meetings are attended.
3. Collecting publicly shareable meeting notes.
4. Providing updates during SIG calls.
5. Sharing the consensus of the SIG.

Liaisons leads may delegate their responsabilities to other SIG members within their group or subgroup.

## Why a Cyber Resilience SIG?

ORC WG is chartered to address any regulation impacting open source communities and open source usage. It can establish Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for domain-specific work. 

The initial focus of ORC WG is to help open source communities and the broader tech industry better understand and prepare to meet the compliance requirements of the European Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). However, cyber resilience is a topic that is broader than Europe. And ORC WG aims to facilitate compliance _across jurisdictions_ (and not only in the EU). A SIG focused on cyber resilience in general--not just on the CRA--will help achieve this goal.

As new regulations impacting open source communities emerge, it is expected that additional SIGs modeled on this initial one will be formed.

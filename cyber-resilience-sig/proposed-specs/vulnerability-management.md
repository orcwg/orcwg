# Vulnerability management specification

The [Vulnerability management specification](https://github.com/orcwg/vulnerability-management-spec/blob/main/spec.md) focuses on vulnerability management for open source codebases. It details the necessary components of a vulnerability management policy, including procedures for receiving reports, resolving issues, and disclosing vulnerabilities. Additionally, it specifies the requirements for managing vulnerable dependencies.

Although the initial motivitation for this specification is to help compliance with the essential requirements of the CRA, the intention is for this specification to be agnostic of a particular legislation.

The Vulnerability management specification, along with related input will be shared with [CEN/CENELEC][] as contribution to the [Harmonised Standard on vulnerability handling](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/blob/main/standards.md#milestone-1---horizontal-standards-due-august-30-2026).

This specification will help open source softare stewards meet the obligations of their light-touch regulatory regime.

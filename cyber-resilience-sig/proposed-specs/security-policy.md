# Security policy for open source software stewards

## Description

[Article 24(1)][] of the CRA states that _"open-source software stewards shall put in place and document in a verifiable manner a cybersecurity policy to foster the development of a secure product with digital elements as well as an effective handling of vulnerabilities by the developers of that product."_ This specification will help open source software stewards meet their obligations by specifying minimum requirements that stewards must implement to meet them and provide a structure or format to document their cybersecurity  policy, possibly in a machine-readable way.

This specification will leverage existing resources and best practies as identified in our [inventory][] and will interact closely with the [Vulnerability management specification][vulnerability management] and the [Specification on principles for cyber resilience for open source development][cyber resilience principles] described above.

This specification will help open source softare stewards meet the obligations of their light-touch regulatory regime.

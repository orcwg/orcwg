## Summary
The revision of the Standardisation Regulation will address the shortcomings identified in the evaluation of the Regulation and aims to speed up the development of systemic standards for the EU's resilience and twin transition.


## Feedback Proposal

### Context
Open source communities play an increasingly vital role in the development of digital technologies and are key drivers of innovation, security, and interoperability in the software ecosystem. However, traditional European standardisation processes have not been designed with the participation models, resource constraints, or collaborative nature of open source in mind. Unlike large corporations with dedicated standardisation teams, open source contributors—often volunteers, SMEs, or staff from non-profit foundations—face significant challenges in engaging meaningfully.
This is particularly urgent in the context of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) implementation, where open source stakeholders are already making efforts to contribute but often face structural limitations that risk excluding their perspectives from the regulatory conversation.
The following aspects represent the main barriers to participating in the standardisation process of the open source community:

### Limited access to working documents
The current document-sharing policies restrict the ability of the open source community to provide meaningful input as a collective. As a result, individuals who contribute to standardisation do so in a personal or organisational capacity, which cannot be considered representative of the broader open source ecosystem. This structural limitation risks overlooking valuable community-driven insights. It also makes it challenging for domain experts to contribute their expertise.

### Participation barriers due to meeting overload
The number of meetings and their high frequency result in a significant number of overlaps between different groups and make it practically impossible for contributors who are not full-time standardisation professionals—such as open source developers and staff from open source foundations—to follow discussions consistently. This creates an unintentional barrier that disproportionately affects the inclusion of resource-constrained actors.

### Synchronous decision-making limits broader participation
The predominantly synchronous nature of decision-making within standardisation activities—often relying on live meetings for key discussions and resolutions—creates an additional barrier for those who cannot dedicate themselves full-time to standardisation work.

### Lack of clear and timely agendas for meetings
Insufficient clarity of agendas for face-to-face and hybrid meetings limits the ability of open source contributors to plan participation in advance. This is particularly challenging for those operating with limited resources who must balance multiple responsibilities.

### Insufficient transparency of open meetings
The level of detail shared in publicly accessible open meetings remains too high-level to enable meaningful feedback from non-members. While overviews are helpful for orientation, constructive contributions can only be made if actual proposals and working drafts are shared. Organising open meetings that lack substantive information risks eroding trust and discouraging future participation from the open source community.

### Lack of standards interoperability
As opposed to enterprises that have to follow all different standards, open source communities typically rely on good practices that are derived from 1-2 standards out of many similar that may exist in the space. With NLF (New Legislative Framework) concepts and the evolving EU certifications schemes, it will be essential to recognise the importance of mutual recognition between EU-developed standards and existing industry standards, including open standards. If open source projects have been following them, it is already contributing significantly to their quality and security. With limited and, often, voluntary resources, new standards coming in could lead to diminishing the good improving intention of those projects, if interoperability is not facilitated at the EU level.

### Support worldwide diversity of experts
In order to achieve the best quality, the EU standardization process should welcome inclusive representation, including open source experts from around the world (not limiting locations or require certain citizenship). We recommend maintaining a reasonable balance between necessary EU-specific expertise, stakeholder inclusion and agility, with explicit support for professionals coming from versatile technology backgrounds such as in software, hardware, etc.

### Underpinning the role of open source organizations
We recommend explicitly recognising global and European open source foundations as key stakeholders and potential facilitators of open source community input into standardisation in the EU standardisation process. It will not only help better facilitate two-way feedback, but would also leverage foundations’ experience and established mechanisms to incentivise the broader contribution from the best open source experts and innovators.

### Open by design and free standards for open source
We recognize that all standards target different industry players. But when the standards affect open source (for example, because of referencing in the EU regulation), it’d be extremely hard for project maintainers finding resources to obtain a proprietary-licensed copy. In this case open and free access should be provided not just to working documents or excerpts, but to the final published standards themselves. In addition, we recommend that implementing a standard does not incur additional licensing fees, which is critical for open source. To make the EU standards transparent and inclusive, beyond free access, this includes providing a clear public history of decisions, comments, and rationale.

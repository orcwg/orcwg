# Contribution to CEN/CENELEC Vulnerability Handling Standard Clause 4.4

## Request

Provide the content for the **informative** section on open source software stewards (Clause 4.4).

## Context

- This is the standard for vulnerability handling covering the requirements defined in [Annex I, Part II](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#anx_I) of the CRA.
- The standard only focuses on what's in this annex, not any other obligations.
- The standard is aimed at manufacturers, not stewards.
- The section we're asked to contribute too is _informative_ (not _normative_), which means it doesn't create any requirements for anybody; it's just there to provide context.

## Goals for the submission

Remind the reader that:

- There are such a thing as stewards.
- This standard doesnâ€™t place requirements on stewards.
- Manufacturers might be considered as stewards for some of their open source projects.
- Manufacturers need to interface with stewards for reporting vulnerabilities.
- Stewards donâ€™t have to fix vulnerabilities that are reported to them, nor do they have to accept fixes for it. In particular they wonâ€™t if those fixes donâ€™t meet the projectâ€™s IP requirements.
- Not all open source projects have stewards and manufacturers might still need to interface with them.
- The existence of a steward isnâ€™t a guarantee that the project meets manufacturer security requirements, manufacturers will need to exercise due diligence regardless. Free and open source security attestations might help facilitate due diligence in the future.

Rationale for these goals:

- Stewards are a new class of actors that manufacturers might not be familiar with, itâ€™s useful to give them additional context.
- Thereâ€™s a common misconception that all open source projects will have stewards, it is useful to remind manufacturers that this isnâ€™t the case.
- As this standard will be behind a paywall, we want to avoid placing any requirements on open source in it.

## Contribution submitted on May 20, 2025

The CRA introduces a new class of market actors: Open-Source Software Stewards (Stewards). This standard does not place any requirements on Stewards. However, the CRA does impose a number of obligations on Stewards, particularly to facilitate vulnerability handling.

Manufacturers are expected to interface with Stewards when reporting vulnerabilities they have discovered in open-source products that the Steward supports. Manufacturers are encouraged to contribute fixes they might have developed for those vulnerabilities under a license compatible with the open-source product.

To facilitate the reporting of vulnerabilities, Stewards shall create, implement, make publicly available, and ensure adherence to a policy on vulnerability handling for the products for which they are Stewards.

Not all open-source projects that a manufacturer depends on should be expected to be supported by a Steward. The obligations of the manufacturers towards those projects remain the same regardless.

Stewards are not responsible for developing remedies for the vulnerabilities reported in the software for which they are Stewards. However, a Steward must report severe incidents of which they are aware that impact the tools and services they provide to support open-source software development. Additionally, a Steward has a limited reporting obligation if they are involved in developing the open-source software for which they are Stewards.

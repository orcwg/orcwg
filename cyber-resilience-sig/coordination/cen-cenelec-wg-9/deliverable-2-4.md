# ~~~Contribution to CEN/CENELEC Vulnerability Handling Standard Annex C~~~

## Request

> [!NOTE]
> CEN/CENELEC W9 plenary decided to rescind this contribution request. As a result the Vulnerability Handling Task Force decided to cancel the deliverable during its [June 19 meeting](../../vulnerability-handling-task-force/2025-06-19-mom-vulnerability-handling-tf.md).

Provide the content for the **informative** section on open source software stewards (Annex C). Additionally, provide:

- Slide to explain contribution process and meeting times.
- Timeline of contributions.
- Annex skeleton by June 30. 

CEN/CENELEC PT 3 contribution goals as listed in PT 3's call for contributions:

> We are looking not only for comments but for actual contributions to creating a section that can help:
>
> — Manufacturers need to understand the interactions with open-source stewards better.
> — Allowing the open source community to have a better overview of this role introduced within the CRA legal text.
> — Make explicit the relation with this actual standard and what is expected and reasonable for this type of economic operator.

> [!WARNING]
> There is a misconception, even from PT 3, that manufacturers will only interface with open source software stewards when dealing with open source software. This obvioulsy isn't the case: many—if not most—open source projects will not have stewards. We need to work with PT 3 to rename the annex and reframe the request to include all open source projects (and not just the subset that will have stewards).

## Context

- This is the standard for vulnerability handling covering the _essential requirements_ defined in [Annex I, Part II](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202402847#anx_I) of the CRA.
- The standard only focuses on those _essential requirements_, not on any other obligations.
- The standard is aimed at manufacturers, not stewards.
- The section we're asked to contribute too is _informative_ (not _normative_), which means it doesn't create any requirements for anybody; it's just there to provide context.
- The section *should not reword the CRA content*, including what stewards are.
- The sections should cover only vulnerability management for now.

## Goals

- Explain to manufacturers how their interactions will be like with open source projects (both with and without stewards) during various parts of the vulnerability management process.
- Improve communication and lighten maintainer-load by explaining to manufacturers what they should and shouldn't expect from open source projects.

## Proposed abstract for the contribution

The annex explains to manufacturers what they should know when interacting with open source projects during vulnerability handling. That includes:

- Brief discussion of various types of open source projects (with and without stewards).
- Descriptions of what open source project expect from manufacturers in terms of submitted information and patches (of fixed vulnerabilities).
- Descriptions of what manufacturers can expect from stewards and open source projects.
- Description of typical Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process followed by open source.
- Information on typical ways to learn about the CVD process followed by a specific project.

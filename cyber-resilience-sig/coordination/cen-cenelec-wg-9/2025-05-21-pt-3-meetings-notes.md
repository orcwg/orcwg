[Contribution](./contribution-pt-3-clause-4-4.md) was presented on May 21, 2025 during a PT 3 call.

- No major comments.
- ToDos:
  - We need to do away with all "shalls", this is informative text.
  - Also have to check that we don't duplicate CRA text.
  - Check with PT 3 Rapporteur that contribution covers what is necessary.

Some discussion in PT 3:

- Suggestion to doublecheck the text is in alignment with PT1's draft.
- Confirmation that the [Standardisation Request](https://github.com/orcwg/cra-hub/tree/main/resources#february-3-2025---standardisation-request) has no reference to stewards, therefore nothing to be considered from that point of view.
- Proposal to remove the text from the "General" clause (clause 4) and move it to Annex.
- Suggestion to consider if the the text is required in the standard at all.
- Conclusion: for time being the text remains as Clause 4.4, moving to Annex or deleting entirely is an easy quick job.

# Reviewing Draft Horizontal Standards For The CRA
The standards which will likely permit manufacturers to be presumed as conformant with the Cyber Resilience Act are being created in two places. Things shared by all manufacturers are being formalised as "horizontal standards" at CEN/CENELEC JTC 13 WG 9 in four project teams, PT1 - PT4. Things specific to vertical application areas are being formalised as "vertical standards" at ETSI, and are covered elsewhere.
As each of the teams produces its deliverable, it is released for public review. The parts of **pEN 40000 "Cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements"**  released so far are:
- PT1 - pEN 40000-1-2 Principles for cyber resilience
- PT2 - Not yet public
- PT3 - Not yet public
- PT4 - pEN 40000-1-1 Vocabulary

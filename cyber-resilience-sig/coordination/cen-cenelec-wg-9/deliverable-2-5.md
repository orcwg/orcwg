# Comments to CEN/CENELEC PT 1 Standard

## Request

As part of its process, CEN/CENELEC WG 9 PT 1 requested comments on its [Horizontal standard on General principles for cyber resilience (JT013089)][JT013089] from its working group participants (note this was not a public call for comments).

## Goals

1. Prevent the open source ecosystem from having to purchase standards to comply to the CRA.
  * Prevent requirements placed on stewards, open source projects, and maintainers in CEN/CENELEC standards as these standards aren't freely available.
2. Avoid placing unnecessary demands on the open source ecosystem
  * Prevent requirements placed on manufacturers that rely on stewards, open source projects, or maintainers performing certain actions they have no obligations to perform.
  * Prevent requirements that might lead manufacturers to expect the same interactions with stewards, open source projects, or maintainers as they have with their suppliers.
3. Maintain a leveled playing field
   * Prevent requirements placed on manufacturers which unfairly favor proprietary software (such as mandating security by obscurity, for example).
4. Maintain Europe's ability to leverage open source
  * Prevent requirements that unreasonably burden manufacturers integrating open source components.

## Comments

We identified two sections of the [Horizontal standard on General principles for cyber resilience (JT013089)][JT013089] that were concerning given the goals stated above and submitted comments for them:

**Section 5.5** which describes a required consultation process when integrating third party components including open source software that would require manufacturers to build a 1:1 relationship with open source maitainers in order to be able to integrate open source components.

**Section 6.12** which essentially describes due diligence requirements for third party componentns, and also included a number of requirements that were concerning given the above mentioned goals.

We submitted our comments on June 12 2025 using the requested docx template.

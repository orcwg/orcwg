# Comments to EU Guidance on open source

The [EU Commission][] requested comments from the open source workstrand of the [CRA Expert Group][] on its first draft of the first part of its Guidance on open source. This was not a public call for comments.

This input was provided to the open source workstrand of the [CRA Expert Group][] on June 20, 2025.

As the draft guidance cannot be shared outside of the CRA Expert Group, neither can the comments.

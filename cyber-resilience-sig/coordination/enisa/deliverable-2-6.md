# Feedback to call for evidence on Cybersecurity Act Revision

## Context

Provide feedback to the [EU Commission][]'s [open call for evidence](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14578-The-EU-Cybersecurity-Act_en) as part of its [initiative to revise the Cybersecurity Act (CSA)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-opens-consultation-revising-eu-cybersecurity-act). Urge for a stronger technical and strategic role for ENISA in light of the [recent funding issues of the US CVE program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#2025_funding_issues) and the increased importance of vulnerability handling in EU legislation.

## Goals

* Urge the EU Commission to increase ENISA's mandate regarding CVE handling
* Avoid disproportionate reliance on U.S. government funding for CVEs

> In light of the and wider need for harmonisation of vulnerability disclosure requirements across several EU regulations (e.g. CRA, NIS2, DORA, AI act) as well as further sharing of supply-chain best-practices, we wish to share and reiterate the importance of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system and a stronger technical and strategic role for ENISA given its growing international objective:
> 
> We recognise the importance of increasing EU resources to ENISA as part of CSA review. Notably, ENISA’s role as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) is important and industry welcomes ENISA’s goal to become a Root CNA.
> 
> We also believe that ENISA should step up as a CNA of Last Resource (for Europe, regardless of report or vendors jurisdiction). Secondly we believe that ENISA should contribute systematically and long term to the CVE system as a whole; in general, and in particular around governance, establishing industry best practices and driving improvements. This also includes a pro-active, operational role, in ensuring that coordinated disclosure processes are followed and that the data is of sufficient quality to be useful in a European setting in general and for compliance with, for example, NIS2 and the CRA in particular. This may, at times, include helping the industry by annotating records, defining vocabulary or by re-publishing advisories after normalisation.
> 
> MITRE’s role as Secretariat plays a key role to provide a resource to boost supply chain resilience. While its recent publicity and uncertainty in funding are regrettable, we are pleased that this matter has now been partially resolved.  
> 
> The momentary alarm did however serve as a timely reminder to both governments and industry as to CVE’s global importance for supply chain resilience and need for wider global support.
> 
> Indeed, this has also been recognised by several European governments who subsequently confirmed their wish to support (technically and financially) and thus we would hope that this support can be mirrored at an EU level, perhaps via ENISA, into a system which is mirrored infrastructure in Europe and co-developed.
> 
> We also see the growing role of national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRTs), such as the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in Ireland, largely supporting bug bounty programs, Capture the Flag (CTF) and other activities with local academia, government and businesses, investing in vulnerability discovery and management, and thus it is important to double down on the CVE program in a uniformed, cross-European and international way.
> 
> It would also be advisable for the European Commission to include this need for reinforced collaboration in their next inter-institutional dialogue with USA CISA.
> 
> Whilst we recognise the importance of NIS2’s European Vulnerability Database (EUVD) we feel there is still room for better alignment and co-ordination. Indeed, the EUVD’s beta version includes identifiers which are not aligned with CVEs or easily mapped.  This poses a significant risk to organisations and companies defending critical networks versus criminal or state sponsored hackers due to similar patterns but dissimilar meanings. This will create chaos for all producers and consumers of software bills of materials (SBOMs) and of vulnerability and exploitation data. It also increases the reporting burden on software producers and open source maintainers if they end up needing to apply for both CVE and EUVD assignments on each disclosed vulnerability.
> 
> We strongly encourage involving all stakeholders, including the security and open source communities, in an open process as the work EUVD and the EU CNA root progresses.
> 
> We remain at your disposal for further information and collaboration. 
> 
> Best regards,
>

# 📅 ORC - Related Conference Tracker

Welcome to the **Conference Space** of the Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC) repository!  
This is a collaborative area to collect and share **Calls for Proposals (CfPs)**, **deadlines**, and **conference details** related to the **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** and open source regulatory compliance topics.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This space helps the community:
- Track upcoming **CfPs** and **submission deadlines**
- Share opportunities to **speak**, **present research**, or **host sessions**
- Coordinate **joint submissions** or **panel proposals**
- Align messaging around CRA and ORC topics

In the '/resources/' folder there are ORC WG materials that can be used in the talks to introduce the work the WG is developing.

## 📝 Upcoming Events

> Note: If panels are available do not hesitate to use the Slack or mailing list to coordinate proposals.

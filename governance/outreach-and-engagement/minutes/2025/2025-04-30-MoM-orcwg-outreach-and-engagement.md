# Minutes

- Presentation of the proposal for the marketing overview of ORC WG.  
    
- During the presentation, there were several aspects that were requested to be integrated into the proposal.  
  - Make explicit that open source projects, not hosted by Foundations are part of the audience ORC WG has to address.  
  - It was requested to enable cooperation with OSPO networks.  
  - Integrate as one of the key messages that the ORC WG should deliver, that the relationship between the manufacturers and the open source projects needs to evolve to address CRA requirements.  
  - Linked to the previous comment, work on industry awareness is required so ORC WG helps them to understand how this new relationship has to be configured.

- Another key area touched on during the presentation was the participation in events:  
  - It was discussed how to enable the promotion of every community member talk around the CRA and the ORC WG.  
  - A second element was the creation of collaterals that can be used in the presentations, helping everyone to communicate what the ORC WG does, and how it helps open source communities in the implementation of the CRA.  
  - It was proposed to develop an ambassador program to support the distribution of the WG message (plan in 2025 to implement in 2026\)  
  - It was commented that it would be great to have ORC WG swag and stickers.  
- Create an [outreach and engagement](https://orcwg.slack.com/archives/C08JHFPFUMQ) dedicated channel in Slack

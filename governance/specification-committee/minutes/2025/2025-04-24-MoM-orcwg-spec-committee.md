### Minutes of the previous meeting

Motion to approve the minutes brought by Simon Phipps  
Minutes approved with the abstention of Brian Fox

### Specification projects, coordination and contributions to CEN/CENELEC and ETSI

It has been identified as challenging stay up to date with all the Standardisation activities meaning:

- CEN/CENELEC  
  - ETSI  
  - CRA Expert Group

So far there are chats for coordinating the participation in the meetings, but it is necessary to share with the broader community. It is proposed that *Eclipse Foundation as member of all the different initiatives coordinate the reporting*.

In addition, there is a dedicated calendar and space in GitHub being prepared to help in coordinating actions and participation in those meetings.

The outcomes of those meetings are expected to be shared through simple docs that capture the main points discussed in those meetings.

No representative of the Specification Committee will be attending in person the CEN/CENELEC meeting in Cyprus, while several will connect remotely.

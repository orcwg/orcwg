# MINUTES

## Quorum: 

Paul Buck acted as chair for the meeting  
Quorum was achieved   
Approval is requested for the minutes from the February 13th, 2025 meeting as drafted \- **Approved**  
Simon Phipps (Software Heritage) has been selected by the ORC Specification Committee as their chair  
Questions were raised regarding the [Cyber Resilience Practices](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/cyber-resilience-practices) project proposal

* Regarding the relationship between the CRA SIG and the specification project, the SIG is not a governance body, specification projects are under the purview of the working group and governed by its specification committee    
* When another specification is created, will it require its own ballot? Yes it will.  
* Has there been any public discussion regarding the proposal to describe it and call for interest? It appears that the proposal has been pre-authored, it appears that the first public communication was in the SIG call earlier in the week. We would have expected that there would have been an earlier call for interest.   
* The committee requests that the project proposal be socialized with a call for interest, and the project can come back to the committee in two weeks (March 13th), seek volunteers  
  * Request is to do that on the working group mailing list

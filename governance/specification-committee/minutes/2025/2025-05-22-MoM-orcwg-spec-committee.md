### Minutes of the previous meeting

Motion brought and seconded with unanimous consensus

### Coordination and contributions to CEN/CENELEC and ETSI

Challenges:

- Involvement of the community and access to documents.  
- Conflict of meetings as a symptom of how unaligned the two ESOs are operating  
- EN18037 referencing \- cost of documents that are referenced.

How the European Commission can make the documents available to everyone involved in the process.  
Not the first time this has happened,

It was agreed to report to the Commission that this way of working doesn’t allow the Open Source community to get properly involved and participate.[^1] 

If the complaint does not provide any positive result, it would be necessary to escalate the situation in CNECT H2.

## AOB

- Timo on PT3 contributions \- related PR \- [https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/pull/101/](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/pull/101/)   
- Chapter in an informative session on Open Source Stewards \- Contribution has been reviewed and handled in the PT3 meeting.  
    
- PT3 contribution from Simon \- the list of features expected from an SBOM a unique identifier to the build included in the component. This could be satsified by ISO/IEC 18670:2025 (SWHID from my sponsor Software Heritage).

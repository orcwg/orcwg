## ORC Marketing Activities

It was discussed two main topics, increase WG participation in the marketing activities and events.  
Regarding the engagement, it was proposed:

* Use the [\#outreach-and-engagement](https://orcwg.slack.com/archives/C08JHFPFUMQ) to discuss marketing initiatives. It is open to anyone who would like to provide feedback on marketing ideas.  
* The marketing team will explore ways to support the community when presenting the ORC (i.e. slides)

In terms of events, it was presented the list of potential candidates to organize ORC related activities, available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Z8M4-d_of59WP47bfncVvTO3vX3E2OZ9GAS_ismBGs/edit?usp=sharing). Based on the preferences and attendance, it will be defined specific actions to implement, present, organize sessions or organize colocated events.  
Also in terms of events, a webinar series is being developed, it will be used Slack to close the details.  
Finally, we discussed the assets developed by LF around the CRA, and the possibilities of cooperating with them in the awareness area.

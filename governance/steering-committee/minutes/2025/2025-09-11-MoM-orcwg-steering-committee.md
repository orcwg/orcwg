- We have started to work on a training program, more details will be shared soon, so far we have discussed about the platform and a high level description of the modules. The details will be shared with the Steering Committee in other meetings. *It has been proposed to organised dedicated session for members as a membership benefit.*  
- CRA Expert group activity was quite low during the summer \- we reported the feedback to the risk assessment proposal.  
- Letter to the ESOs \- it was discussed how to proceed with the signing and *it was agreed that the co-chairs will be signing on behalf of the WG.*

EF Staffing:

- As presented in the email shared by Gaël in the mailing list, we have evolved the structure of the staff involved in the working group.  
- The team has been divided in 4 areas with a main contact for each of them  
  - Community management \- Juan  
  - Marketing, outreach and engagement \- Shanda

  - Vulnerability handling \- Marta, Mikael and Æva  
  - Launching of new items \- Juan  
- The policy work involves:   
  - Our activity in the CRA Expert Group. *It was proposed to increase the visibility of the activities in the CRA expert group by:*  
    - *Socializing the topics that are under discussion (as done in the glossary).*  
    - *Linking the feedback to the base content to have a better understanding and the right context.*  
    - *Track history of interactions with the CRA Expert group*  
  - The other area is Coordination with the ESOs.

### CEN/CENELEC PT3

- It was discussed how to react to the request by the European Commission of having open source included as part of the standard.

- The SC agreed on the Program Manager preparing a communication to the CEN/CENELEC WG9 PT3 representatives with a proposal based on the outcomes of the next WG9 PT3 meeting.

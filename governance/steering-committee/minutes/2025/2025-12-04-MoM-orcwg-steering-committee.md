Agenda accepted

### Approval of the minutes of the previous Steering Committee meeting

- Approved by the SC with no comments

### Program Plan Approval

- The program plan was presented with the latest modifications based on the comments received through the validation process. The version to be approved and moved as v1.0 is v0.3.  
- It was clarified that the document with the description and clarification of the metrics is also part of the program plan, and will be made available to the community.  
- Before voting the resolution for the approval of the program plan it was requested by the members of the Steering Committee to review the financial plan.

### Financial Plan

- The financial plan was presented as the Eclipse Foundation fund allocation to support the implementation of the program plan.  
- The current proposal doesn’t include the level of granularity that the Steering Committee would like to see, but accepts that this format could work for the purpose.  
- The steering committee is also concerned about what happens and how to react if the forecast, especially in the revenue side, is not met; therefore it is agreed to have specific slots to evaluate the progress of the ORC WG towards the achievement of the objectives set, both technical and financial, on a quarterly basis.

### Code and Compliance FOSDEM Edition \+ 2026 Marketing plan introduction

    - Due Diligence Made Simple: Attestations, Open Source, and Your Path to Faster, Safer Compliance  
    - Navigating the New Regulatory Landscape: CRA, AI Act, and What Manufacturers Must Prepare For.  
  - The team is working to get the agenda finalised by the end of the week of the 8th.

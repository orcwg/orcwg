# ORC WG Working Mode

This document captures how the ORC WG operates. It can be amended or broken down into smaller policies and processes as needed.

## Applicable documents

The ORC WG is subject to its [charter](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/open-regulatory-compliance-charter.php) and the various documents it references, in particular: the Eclipse Foundation Working Group [Process](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/process.php) and [Operations Guide](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/operations.php).

## Special Interest Groups

The ORC WG will establish Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for domain-specific work (i.e. Cyber and AI). Currently the following SIGs have been established:

| SIG Name | Related Specification Project |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Cyber Resilience SIG](../cyber-resilience-sig/) | [Cyber Resilicence Practices Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/cyber-resilience-practices) |

### Related Specification Project

When a SIG intends to create specifications, a related Specification Project will be created. This related Specification Project will serve as an umbrella project for all of the specifications that this SIG intends to create.

### Task forces

SIGs can form task forces that focus on a particular topic for a fixed period of time.

A task force must must have one or more leads, an area of focus, a set of deliverables, and an end date by which it must present its deliverables and recommendations to the SIG and/or request an extension.

A task force's proceedings are public.

Task forces do not have any decision-making authority. Their role is advisory. Their deliverables do not represent the consensus of the SIG nor of the WG unless the SIG or WG formally adopts them.

### Deliverables plan

When appropriate, a SIG will create a deliverables plan.

The SIG's deliverables plan will be approved by the _Steering Committee_.

This plan will clearly indicate which deliverables are specifications (which follow the [Eclipse Specification Process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/)) and which are not.

The development of the specifications will happen under the SIG's [related specification project][]. The list of specifications contained in the deliverables plan will be approved by the _Specification Committee_ as part of the [Creation Review](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-creation) or [Plan Review](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/efsp/#efsp-reviews-plan) of the related specification project.

The development of the other deliverables will happen in the SIG, either directly or through dedicated task forces.

## Meetings

Meetings:

- should be announced sufficiently in advance
- should be listed on [`MEETINGS.md`](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/MEETINGS.md) and included in the [community calendar]([url](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg?tab=readme-ov-file#get-involved)).
- should publish an agenda sufficiently in advance and enable membership input to it
- should have their minutes available publicly shortly after the meeting (and at least before the next meeting)

Meeting minutes:

- should list meeting participants and their affiliations
- should summarize discussion points
- should not capture every comment or question raised
- should not attribute comments to individuals
- should capture group consensus, resolutions, and action items
- should be provided in a draft format for comments
- should be approved at the latest at the beginning of the next meeting

Note: meetings of governing bodies have additional requirements defined in the [relevant documents](#applicable-documents).

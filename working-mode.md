# ORC WG Working Mode

This document captures how the ORC WG operates. It can be amended or broken down into smaller policies and processes as needed.

## Applicable documents

The ORC WG is subject to its [charter](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/open-regulatory-compliance-charter.php) and the various documents it references, in particular: the Eclipse Foundation Working Group [Process](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/process.php) and [Operations Guide](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/operations.php).

## Task Forces

Special Interest Groups of the ORC WG can form task forces that focus on a particular topic for a fixed period of time.

A task force must have one or more leads, an area of focus, a set of deliverables, and an end date by which it must present its deliverables and recommendations to the SIG and/or request an extension.

A task force's proceedings are public.

Task forces do not have any decision-making authority. Their role is advisory. Their deliverables do not represent the consensus of the SIG nor of the WG unless the SIG or WG formally adopts them.

A GitHub team is created for every task force. The task force leads are assigned the role of maintainer for that team.

## Meetings

Meetings:

- should be announced sufficiently in advance
- should be listed on [`MEETINGS.md`](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg/blob/main/MEETINGS.md) and included in the [community calendar]([url](https://github.com/orcwg/orcwg?tab=readme-ov-file#get-involved)).
- should publish an agenda sufficiently in advance and enable membership input to it
- should have their minutes available publicly shortly after the meeting (and at least before the next meeting)

Meeting minutes:

- should list meeting participants and their affiliations
- should summarize discussion points
- should not capture every comment or question raised
- should not attribute comments to individuals
- should capture group consensus, resolutions, and action items
- should be provided in a draft format for comments
- should be approved at the latest at the beginning of the next meeting

Note: meetings of governing bodies have additional requirements defined in the [relevant documents](#applicable-documents).

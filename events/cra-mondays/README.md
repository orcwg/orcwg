### üóìÔ∏è June 23, 2025: Pedro Demolder on The CRA: Why even your fridge might need a lawyer

Most of the impact of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) on the open source ecosystem will be indirect ‚Äì but not insignificant. As manufacturers face new due diligence obligations when integrating open source components into their products and services, it‚Äôs essential to understand how open source is legally categorized under the CRA and what that means in practice.
In this session, we‚Äôll explore what this categorization implies for open source contributors and maintainers, how we can prepare for the changes ahead, and how the open source community might even benefit from constructive dialogue around compliance. You‚Äôll gain insight into how manufacturers and their legal teams approach CRA compliance ‚Äì and how that mindset could affect your project.
Who better to guide us through this than a lawyer specializing in IT compliance? That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre excited to welcome Pedro Demolder, attorney at Timelex, who will share how he advises clients navigating the CRA and what it means for the future of open source.

### üóìÔ∏è June 9, 2025: Arnaud Le Hors on Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)

SLSA is a security framework, a specification, for describing and incrementally improving supply chain security, established by industry consensus within OpenSSF. It is organized into a series of levels that describe increasing security guarantees, to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure. It‚Äôs how you get from "safe enough" to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the software supply chain. This presentation will introduce attendees to SLSA, its current status, and what‚Äôs in the works. ([slides](2025-06-09-ArnaudLeHors.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/5t9EGPTll64))

### üóìÔ∏è May 26, 2025: Fukami on learning how to stop worrying and love the NLF
The New Legislative Framework (NLF) is a package of EU measures that reinforces the application and enforcement of internal market legislation in the EU. It also establishes a common legal framework for products in the form of a toolbox of measures for use in future legislation on which the CRA builds. In this presentation, Fukami will dive into the NLF and how it relates to the CRA and other European product legislation. The aim is to get a better understanding of the key parts, including market oversight, the role of standards, CE marking and the Blue Guide and document how to place products on the European market.

### üóìÔ∏è May 12, 2025: Maxim Baele on OWASP SAMM
The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/) is an open framework designed to help organizations implement a Secure Development LifeCycle (SDLC). 
Understanding how manufacturers implement the processes required to build products that are secure by design, is essential to understand how they will consider their due diligence requirements when ingesting open source components. 
Maxim Baele is one of the SAMM core team members that maintain the model, using it on a daily basis to help organizations across the globe build secure products.

### üóìÔ∏è April 28, 2025: Olle E. Johansson on managing CVEs in an unstable world
The cybersecurity community has been up in arms over the last few days as MITRE announced that its US government funding for running the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program wasn't being renewed. While the funding was extended since, this was a wakeup call for the community. Olle E. Johansson shared an [opinionated white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6yPlCla7SO6YuHakjvmcGtcEmHdp-NANaqpTDTA7Q0/edit?usp=sharing) on this topic. He'll be presenting this paper during the call and we'll use it as a basis for discussion.

This talk will cover a proposal for a globally coordinated platform for vulnerability reporting that ensures transparency, strengthens manufacturer accountability, and enables trusted third-party data enrichment. As cybersecurity regulations for connected products advance worldwide, the current model‚Äîprimarily funded by a single state and dependent on unaffiliated third parties for critical data‚Äîfaces limitations in scalability and neutrality. A new approach is needed: one that gives manufacturers control over submitted data, integrates independent data providers, and is governed and funded by a diverse coalition of global stakeholders. The session will explore how such a system can enhance trust, regulatory alignment, and security for both users and industry.

**Olle E.Johanson** is an experienced and appreciated speaker, teacher as well as an Open Source developer and consultant. He is currently project lead for OWASP Project Koala- developing the Transparency Exchange API (TEA), member of the CycloneDX industry working group, the OWASP SBOM Forum, co-founder of SBOMEurope.eu and a leader for the DNS TAPIR Open Source project. While not trying to save the world with SBOMs, he is helping clients with the journey towards CRA compliance as a consultant in his company Edvina AB.

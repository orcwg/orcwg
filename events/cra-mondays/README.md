### üóìÔ∏è June 23, 2025: Pedro Demolder on managing CRA compliance from a legal perspective

Most of the impact of the CRA on the open source ecosystem will be indirect, through manufacturers exercising due diligence when integrating open source components in their products. How can we prepare for this, help avoid friction, and even possibly create better outcomes for the open source ecosystem? By better understanding the mindset of manufacturers faced with the compliance requirements of the CRA. And who better than a lawyer specialized in IT compliance to walk us through it? That's why we're so excited to welcome Pedro Demolder, Attorney at Timelex, who will share with us how he's advising his clients on CRA compliance.

 üóìÔ∏è When: **June 23, 5pm CEST** - right after the SIG Call ([in your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=2025-06-23T15:00:00.000Z&msg=CRA%20Mondays))\

### üóìÔ∏è May 26, 2025: Fukami on learning how to stop worrying and love the NLF
The New Legislative Framework (NLF) is a package of EU measures that reinforces the application and enforcement of internal market legislation in the EU. It also establishes a common legal framework for products in the form of a toolbox of measures for use in future legislation on which the CRA builds. In this presentation, Fukami will dive into the NLF and how it relates to the CRA and other European product legislation. The aim is to get a better understanding of the key parts, including market oversight, the role of standards, CE marking and the Blue Guide and document how to place products on the European market.

### üóìÔ∏è May 12, 2025: Maxim Baele on OWASP SAMM
The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/) is an open framework designed to help organizations implement a Secure Development LifeCycle (SDLC). 
Understanding how manufacturers implement the processes required to build products that are secure by design, is essential to understand how they will consider their due diligence requirements when ingesting open source components. 
Maxim Baele is one of the SAMM core team members that maintain the model, using it on a daily basis to help organizations across the globe build secure products.

### üóìÔ∏è April 28, 2025: Olle E. Johansson on managing CVEs in an unstable world
The cybersecurity community has been up in arms over the last few days as MITRE announced that its US government funding for running the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program wasn't being renewed. While the funding was extended since, this was a wakeup call for the community. Olle E. Johansson shared an [opinionated white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6yPlCla7SO6YuHakjvmcGtcEmHdp-NANaqpTDTA7Q0/edit?usp=sharing) on this topic. He'll be presenting this paper during the call and we'll use it as a basis for discussion.

This talk will cover a proposal for a globally coordinated platform for vulnerability reporting that ensures transparency, strengthens manufacturer accountability, and enables trusted third-party data enrichment. As cybersecurity regulations for connected products advance worldwide, the current model‚Äîprimarily funded by a single state and dependent on unaffiliated third parties for critical data‚Äîfaces limitations in scalability and neutrality. A new approach is needed: one that gives manufacturers control over submitted data, integrates independent data providers, and is governed and funded by a diverse coalition of global stakeholders. The session will explore how such a system can enhance trust, regulatory alignment, and security for both users and industry.

**Olle E.Johanson** is an experienced and appreciated speaker, teacher as well as an Open Source developer and consultant. He is currently project lead for OWASP Project Koala- developing the Transparency Exchange API (TEA), member of the CycloneDX industry working group, the OWASP SBOM Forum, co-founder of SBOMEurope.eu and a leader for the DNS TAPIR Open Source project. While not trying to save the world with SBOMs, he is helping clients with the journey towards CRA compliance as a consultant in his company Edvina AB.

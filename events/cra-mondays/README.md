# CRA Mondays

## Next edition: April 28, 2025: Olle E. Johansson on managing CVEs in an unstable world
This talk willcover a proposal for a globally coordinated platform for vulnerability reporting that ensures transparency, strengthens manufacturer accountability, and enables trusted third-party data enrichment. As cybersecurity regulations for connected products advance worldwide, the current model‚Äîprimarily funded by a single state and dependent on unaffiliated third parties for critical data‚Äîfaces limitations in scalability and neutrality. A new approach is needed: one that gives manufacturers control over submitted data, integrates independent data providers, and is governed and funded by a diverse coalition of global stakeholders. The session will explore how such a system can enhance trust, regulatory alignment, and security for both users and industry.

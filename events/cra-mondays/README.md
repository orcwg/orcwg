## üóìÔ∏è Next edition: May 12, 2025: Maxim Baele on OWASP SAMM

The [OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owasp.org/www-project-samm/) is an open framework designed to help organizations implement a Secure Development LifeCycle (SDLC). 
Understanding how manufacturers implement the processes required to build products that are secure by design, is essential to understand how they will consider their due diligence requirements when ingesting open source components. 
Maxim Baele is one of the SAMM core team members that maintain the model, using it on a daily basis to help organizations across the globe build secure products.

[Maxim Baele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximbaele/) is an experienced cybersecurity consultant specializing in product and application security‚Äã, with a background in Linux system engineering, security architecture, and automation‚Äã.
He spends his days coaching organizations in building secure products and implementing cybersecurity strategies‚Äã, while spending many of his evenings contributing to OWASP as a liaison, as a board member for OWASP BE and a core team member of the OWASP SAMM project.

### üóìÔ∏è April 28, 2025: Olle E. Johansson on managing CVEs in an unstable world
The cybersecurity community has been up in arms over the last few days as MITRE announced that its US government funding for running the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program wasn't being renewed. While the funding was extended since, this was a wakeup call for the community. Olle E. Johansson shared an [opinionated white paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u6yPlCla7SO6YuHakjvmcGtcEmHdp-NANaqpTDTA7Q0/edit?usp=sharing) on this topic. He'll be presenting this paper during the call and we'll use it as a basis for discussion.

This talk willcover a proposal for a globally coordinated platform for vulnerability reporting that ensures transparency, strengthens manufacturer accountability, and enables trusted third-party data enrichment. As cybersecurity regulations for connected products advance worldwide, the current model‚Äîprimarily funded by a single state and dependent on unaffiliated third parties for critical data‚Äîfaces limitations in scalability and neutrality. A new approach is needed: one that gives manufacturers control over submitted data, integrates independent data providers, and is governed and funded by a diverse coalition of global stakeholders. The session will explore how such a system can enhance trust, regulatory alignment, and security for both users and industry.

**Olle E.Johanson** is an experienced and appreciated speaker, teacher as well as an Open Source developer and consultant. He is currently project lead for OWASP Project Koala- developing the Transparency Exchange API (TEA), member of the CycloneDX industry working group, the OWASP SBOM Forum, co-founder of SBOMEurope.eu and a leader for the DNS TAPIR Open Source project. While not trying to save the world with SBOMs, he is helping clients with the journey towards CRA compliance as a consultant in his company Edvina AB.

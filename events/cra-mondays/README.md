### February 16: Open Source Governance in the Global South: Challenges, Opportunities & Compliance in Africa

Open source is a global movement, but the practices, pressures, and compliance realities vary dramatically across regions. In Africa and the broader Global South, developers are building critical digital infrastructure, maintaining widely used libraries, and contributing to major ecosystems  yet often without the governance structures, compliance tooling, or regulatory awareness common in Europe and North America. As the global software supply chain becomes more regulated, particularly with frameworks like the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), this regional disparity becomes a supply-chain risk and a missed opportunity.

<summary>More info</summary>
This session explores the intersection of open-source governance, compliance, and developer experience in Africa, drawing from real-world observations within local developer communities, university ecosystems, and open-source contributor networks. It highlights key structural challenges from limited access to tooling and training, to unclear licensing knowledge, inconsistent documentation culture, and lack of exposure to compliance-driven workflows such as SBOM generation, vulnerability reporting, and maintenance obligations.

But the session is not only about challenges. It also showcases emerging strengths and opportunities, including community-driven governance models, lightweight compliance workflows adapted for low-resource environments, and successful examples of African projects contributing to secure and compliant open-source ecosystems.

Attendees will learn:

1. How compliance expectations (e.g., CRA, SBOM requirements, supply-chain attestations) impact open-source maintainers and contributors in the Global South.

2. Practical ways organizations can support global contributors to reduce compliance friction in distributed open-source development.

3. Governance strategies that help maintainers improve transparency, code quality, licensing clarity, and long-term sustainability.

4. Why strengthening compliance awareness in Africa enhances the trustworthiness and resilience of the entire global open-source supply chain.

This talk offers a perspective rarely highlighted in open-source governance discussions, bridging geographic, cultural, and infrastructural gaps. Participants will leave with actionable insights, potential collaboration pathways, and a deeper understanding of how to build more equitable and compliant global open-source ecosystems.

### March 2: Software Hash Identifier introduction and applications to in-development standards

It will not be possible to scale up the identification of software based on software packages names. The usage of extrinsic identifiers requires an external, trusted, entity to host the references table. Intrinsic identifiers solve this issue, indemnifying software unequivocally, even supporting external references. Out of the existing intrinsic identifiers, SWHID is the standard one with open governance as well as a implementation example of a big enough scale, Software Heritage.

The existence of such identifiers is essential for regulators and standardization bodies, since they enables a level of trust in evidences you cannot reach in any other way, at big enough scale.

### February 2: Anyone who still puts AI-generated code into circulation today has conditional intent to infringe the law – how to limit or at least defer the risk

AI tools such as GitHub Copilot are not creative geniuses – they copy! And they do so more frequently and more demonstrably than many people believe. Anyone who incorporates AI-generated code into their software today is often already acting with conditional intent – and making themselves vulnerable to claims for damages, injunctions, and even criminal consequences. ([slides](2026-02-02%20-%20Andreas%20Kotulla%20and%20Florian%20Hackel.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/diBqxCtBraI))

**Knowledge attendees should have before joining the session**

The session is designed for a mixed audience of legal, compliance and technical stakeholders. To get the most value, attendees should ideally have:
A basic understanding of software development workflows, including the use of third-party code, libraries and tools in the SDLC.
A general awareness of copyright and IP in software (e.g. that source code is protected as a copyrighted work, and that reuse without permission can be problematic).
For legal/compliance professionals: familiarity with general liability concepts (e.g. negligence vs. intent, organisational duties, due diligence) is helpful.
For technical participants: some experience with or curiosity about AI coding assistants (e.g. Copilot, CodeWhisperer, ChatGPT-based coding) and how they are used in day-to-day development.

**What attendees will learn from the session**

Attendees will leave the session with a clear picture of the liability landscape around AI-generated code and a practical checklist of measures to avoid turning their own software products into a legal “ticking time bomb"

### 🗓️ November 24, 2025: When Disclosure Fails: Europe’s Struggle with CVD

Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is written into NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act as a cornerstone of Europe’s cybersecurity policy. In practice, though, the system is failing. When I reported a vulnerability in a major Belgian bank through the official channels, I was met with bureaucracy, legal threats, and a total lack of technical engagement; both from both the bank and Belgium’s national cybersecurity authority. What should have been a routine disclosure turned into a long standoff that perfectly illustrates how Europe’s CVD framework is broken. ([slides](2025-11-24_CVD.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/G37gXO0KG6I))

<details>
<summary>More info</summary>

In this talk, I’ll show how these problems aren’t just Belgian, but systemic. Across the EU, policymakers treat CVD as a means to impose requirements on reporters instead of a commitment by organisations to receive and fix vulnerabilities. They confuse disclosure with bug bounties, enforce pointless formalities, and discourage the very people trying to help. I’ll explain what went wrong, why it matters for NIS2 and the CRA, and how we can fix CVD before it collapses under its own red tape. 

**Speaker: Piet De Vaere, Product Cybersecurity Consultant**

### 🗓️ November 10, 2025: OSS provenance and code signing: how SignPath Foundation guarantees software integrity for its member projects

Some OSS projects are maintained by a foundation like Eclipse, Apache, or Mozilla with often rigorous governance over the release process. However, this approach doesn’t scale, so most OSS projects ship unverified and often unsigned releases. This breaks the trust model of Linus’s Law, which is based on source code. Also, OSS releases are often unsigned, leading to a major security degradation and often usability issues. Unverified signing can lead to issues like the 2024 XZ Utils incident. ([video](https://youtu.be/_fGOgByN08c))

<details>
<summary>More info</summary>

 SignPath Foundation provides free and secure code signing for 250 OSS projects. To achieve this, we had to go beyond key security: how can we guarantee that releases are safe to use?

Key points:

- Introduction of SignPath foundation
- OSS project vetting and approval process
- Automatic provenance verification of releases
- Code signing challenges
- CA certificate provisioning
- Goals and limits of security and process vouching

### 🗓️ September 15, 2025: Why Do You Trust Software? Operationalizing CRA with the Eclipse Trustable Software Framework

Modern products—from cars and planes to medical devices and consumer gadgets—depend on millions of lines of software hidden deep inside. The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) now requires manufacturers and suppliers to prove that this software is secure, maintained, and resilient over the long term. But while the CRA defines *what* must be achieved, the industry is still asking *how*.

The Eclipse Trustable Software Framework (TSF) may provide part of the answer. Built around six trustable tenets and exploring a FICO-style Trustable Score, TSF suggests a path for making software trust more measurable and auditable. In this session, we’ll discuss how TSF could complement CRA obligations, where it may help engineers, executives, and regulators, and why open collaboration is essential to shaping the future of trustable software.

### 🗓️ June 23, 2025: Pedro Demolder on The CRA: Why even your fridge might need a lawyer

Most of the impact of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) on the open source ecosystem will be indirect – but not insignificant. As manufacturers face new due diligence obligations when integrating open source components into their products and services, it’s essential to understand how open source is legally categorized under the CRA and what that means in practice.
In this session, we’ll explore what this categorization implies for open source contributors and maintainers, how we can prepare for the changes ahead, and how the open source community might even benefit from constructive dialogue around compliance. You’ll gain insight into how manufacturers and their legal teams approach CRA compliance – and how that mindset could affect your project.
Who better to guide us through this than a lawyer specializing in IT compliance? That’s why we’re excited to welcome Pedro Demolder, attorney at Timelex, who will share how he advises clients navigating the CRA and what it means for the future of open source.

<details>
<summary>More info</summary>

This talk will cover a proposal for a globally coordinated platform for vulnerability reporting that ensures transparency, strengthens manufacturer accountability, and enables trusted third-party data enrichment. As cybersecurity regulations for connected products advance worldwide, the current model—primarily funded by a single state and dependent on unaffiliated third parties for critical data—faces limitations in scalability and neutrality. A new approach is needed: one that gives manufacturers control over submitted data, integrates independent data providers, and is governed and funded by a diverse coalition of global stakeholders. The session will explore how such a system can enhance trust, regulatory alignment, and security for both users and industry.

**Olle E.Johanson** is an experienced and appreciated speaker, teacher as well as an Open Source developer and consultant. He is currently project lead for OWASP Project Koala- developing the Transparency Exchange API (TEA), member of the CycloneDX industry working group, the OWASP SBOM Forum, co-founder of SBOMEurope.eu and a leader for the DNS TAPIR Open Source project.

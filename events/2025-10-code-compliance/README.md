## Event Summary

### Towards a New Collaboration Paradigm: Manufacturers, Stewards, Maintainers and Authorities

_Summary to come_


### Understanding the Stewardship Role in CRA Compliance 
This talk provided an in-depth update on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its evolving implications for open source stewards and the broader software industry. Dirk-Willem highlighted the significant progress made over the past year, noting that open source foundations are now widely engaged and that regulatory guidance has become clearer, particularly around the exemption of open source stewards from fines and their limited compliance obligations. While challenges remain, especially around low-quality standards and issues related to SBOMs and identifiers, the overall direction is positive, with the European Commission emphasising proportional and practical implementation. The talk emphasised that most open source foundations already exceed regulatory requirements and should now focus on producing shared resources such as security policies, risk assessments, and attestations that can support downstream users. The session concluded with a call to collaborate on creating these materials collectively, positioning open source communities to not only comply with the CRA but also strengthen their leadership in secure software development.



### Opportunities to Participate in Standardisation  

The panel provided a comprehensive overview of the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and its ongoing standardization efforts by organisations such as ETSI and CEN-CENELEC, highlighting the critical juncture at which the open source community can shape these definitions and implementations. While ETSI is pioneering more accessible "vertical standards" via GitLab for public comment, the integration of the decentralized open source community into traditional, industry-centric standardization processes remains a significant challenge, often demanding substantial time and resources. Despite these hurdles, there are clear opportunities for open source participants to contribute to and influence these standards, ensuring that regulations do not inadvertently hinder the vast open source ecosystem, particularly given that most individual projects are exempt unless commercialised. Continued community involvement is vital to safeguard the future of open source software within this regulatory landscape.
